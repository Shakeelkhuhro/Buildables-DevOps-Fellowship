# Week 3 Report - Fellowship Program

## Introduction
In Week 3 of the fellowship program, the focus was on **Virtualization, Containerization**, and **Automation** using GitHub Actions. 
We learned how Docker simplifies application deployment and how GitHub Actions enables CI/CD workflows.

---

## 1. Virtualization & Containerization
- Virtualization allows running multiple operating systems on a single machine.
- Containerization packages applications and dependencies together for portability and scalability.
- Containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines.

---

## 2. Docker
We explored Docker, a leading containerization platform.

### Key Learnings:
- Docker Architecture (Engine, Images, Containers, Registry)
- Building Docker images using **Dockerfile**
- Running and managing containers
- Working with Docker networks and volumes

### Practical Tasks:
- Pull and run containers
- Build custom Docker images
- Write simple Dockerfiles
- Use Docker Hub for storing images

---

## 3. GitHub Actions
We practiced using **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipelines.

### Key Learnings:
- YAML-based workflow definitions
- Trigger workflows on push and pull requests
- Run jobs in containers
- Use GitHub Marketplace actions
- Automate Docker builds and deployment

### Practical Tasks:
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Configure build and test jobs
- Automate Docker image build and push

---

## Key Outcomes
- Understood the difference between virtualization and containerization
- Gained hands-on experience with Docker commands and Dockerfiles
- Learned to automate workflows using GitHub Actions

---

## Conclusion
Week 3 enhanced our understanding of containerization with Docker and automation with GitHub Actions. These are essential skills for building scalable, efficient DevOps pipelines.
